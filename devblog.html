A place to talk about prototypes, questionable design decisions, and the
small discoveries that shape every build.
Keep this short and honest. The messy middle is the point.

[Log 006] DynOSTiC | Done
  July the 25th, 2026
  After a few days tinkering with Kaíven and ëëntïï, my dissatisfaction
  with both kept growing. I felt boxed in. So I said, "fuckit, no one's
  waiting", and started a new engine: DynOSTiC (Dynamics of the Space-Time
  Continuum). It has the features I need to build both games the way I
  want.

[Log 005] Episodic Adventure Game | In Progress
  July the 16th, 2026 | Kaíven
  I always imagined Kaíven as a graphic novel. And it still might be.
  But one morning I woke up with a different certainty.
  Fuck it.
  This story does not want to stay still on the page. It wants to be
  walked through. Paused. Interrupted. Lived in fragments.
  So it becomes an episodic adventure game.
  And if it needs its own engine, then I will build that too.
  Not because it is efficient. Not because it is sensible.
  Because it feels right.
  This is how the adventure begins.

[Log 004] Entomolist vs Interdimensional Beings | In Progress
  July the 15th, 2026 | ëëntïï
  I have always been fascinated by ants. By spiders. By the countless
  species that live beside us, unnoticed, carrying entire worlds on their
  backs.
  There is something honest about them. No mythology. No ambition. Just
  survival, structure, and fragile balance.
  Today, I started working on ëëntïï.
  It is the story of an entomologist who learns -- quietly, without
  ceremony -- that he has been given a task by the Cosmos itself:
  protect the Ant Queen, or watch a species vanish.
  This is not a game about heroism. It is about terror. The slow kind.
  The kind that comes from realizing the weight on your shoulders is real,
  and that no one is coming to help.
  ëëntïï is about responsibility at a cosmic scale, filtered through the
  smallest of lives. About what it feels like to be chosen not for glory,
  but because extinction has no patience.

[Log 003] Server Deployment | In Progress
  July the 14th, 2026 | Guns, Lots of Guns
  We have reached a point with great features. For now, we are focusing
  on deployment.
  - Servers should remember: each server owns its own database. Scores are
    saved per map. Map state persists. Worlds stop being disposable.
  - Servers should belong to themselves: no single central brain. Each
    shard keeps its history.
  - Observability without interference: an admin app is coming. Stats,
    discovery, health.
  - Services: AWS, Fly.io and self-hosted machines.

[Log 002] Mining Rigs and Katana Melee Mode | Done
  July the 10th, 2026 | Guns, Lots of Guns
  We expanded the economy and close-quarters options with mining rigs and
  a dedicated katana melee mode. This update is about giving players new
  reasons to move, build, and commit to risky plays.
  - Mining rigs as long-term investments: set them up, protect them, and
    turn risk into sustained income.
  - Katana melee mode for high-risk aggression: a fast, close-range option
    that rewards commitment and timing.
  - Resource-driven pacing: rigs encourage map control, while melee creates
    sharp spikes of danger and payoff.

[Log 001] Turrets and Drones | Done
  July the 5th, 2026 | Guns, Lots of Guns
  We added two major combat companions into the live build: automated
  turrets and support drones. The goal is to make moment-to-moment fights
  feel more tactical while keeping the core gunplay fast.
  - Turrets as battlefield anchors: place-and-hold gameplay for tight
    corridors, choke points, and objective defense.
  - Drones as mobile support: faster repositioning and adaptive coverage in
    open arenas.
  - Clear role separation: turrets lean into area denial while drones skew
    toward flexible pressure and cleanup.
