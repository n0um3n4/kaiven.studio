I know you are looking for me.
We both know you are trying to make me click on those emails.
You know I know you are watching me, tracking me.
You certainly know I have nothing of value to you.
Nor money, nor info about anyone or anything else.
Which baffles me... what do you really want from me?
I'm not a threat to you or them.
I'm nobody and yet... you keep trying and trying.
I know.

Why?
